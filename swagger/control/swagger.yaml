      description: |
        Updates the channel uniquely identified by a descriptor.

        If there is already a channel associated with the descriptor, the old channel is overwritten with the new one.

        In order to enforce the min_period between messages, the Relay server keeps track of the time of the most
        recently relayed message for each descriptor. If a channel is overwritten, the time of relay of the most
        recent message is erased unless the new channel has the same min_period field as the old one.
